## 🎯 Objective

**Build a deep, intuitive, and understanding knowledge.**

```
Bottom-Up                          Top-Down
(Discrete Math)                    (System Design)
     │                                  │
     │    ┌──────────────────────┐      │
     └───▶│  Meet in the Middle  │◀─────┘
          │                      │
          │  Foundry (Capstone)  │
          │  ML Platform Project │
          └──────────────────────┘
```

### The Pipeline

```
Axiom → Math Structure → Computer Science Theory → Software Practice
```

Traversable in both directions:
- **Why does this work?** (trace down to foundations)
- **What does this enable?** (trace up to applications)

### The Feeling

> "The derivative of an orange is a slice."
Intuition so deep that you don't calculate, you *see and feel*.

## Principles

- **Build to understand**: projects over passive reading
- **Explain to learn**: if you can't teach it, you don't know it
- **Connect ideas**: link notes across areas
- **Question assumptions**: start from first principles
- **Iterate**: notes evolve as understanding deepens

---
## The Rule
Don't read to prepare. Build until you're stuck, then read to get unstuck.

- **Stuck on how to version models?** → Read DDIA chapter on data models
- **Stuck on training pipeline?** → Read Chip Huyen on model development
- **Stuck on scaling?** → Read Alex Xu on the specific pattern

Just-in-time, not just-in-case.

*The goal is not to collect notes. The goal is to become the engineer who doesn't need them!*
